    "### INTRODUCTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction of heart disease can significantly reduce mortality through timely diagnosis and intervention. Machine Learning (ML) provides a powerful approach to detect patterns in clinical data and predict health risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on predicting heart disease using multiple ML models. The work includes reproducing results from a selected research paper and implementing a new contribution model to evaluate improvements in accuracy and performance.\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### AIM :\n",
    "\n",
    "To reproduce the methodology of a heart disease prediction research paper and introduce a new machine learning model (Random Forest) as a significant contribution to improve predictive performance.\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### Github Repo:\n",
    "https://github.com/kelvinikros/AIDI1002_FinalProject_HeartDiseaseProject\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### DESCRIPTION OF PAPER:\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected research paper, “Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning” (2023), examines the use of machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, and KNN to predict heart disease based on clinical attributes including age, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper highlights challenges in early diagnosis and demonstrates that ML models can support clinical decision-making. It also suggests that ensemble methods or neural networks may improve prediction accuracy, which aligns with the contribution implemented in this project.\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### PROBLEM STATEMENT :\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a patient is at risk of heart disease (target = 1) or not at risk (target = 0) using structured clinical data.\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM:\n",
    "*Early detection of heart disease allows for better treatment planning and reduces the likelihood of severe outcomes such as heart attacks. However, manual assessment based on symptoms and lab values can be inconsistent. Machine learning models can analyze complex patterns in clinical features and assist healthcare providers in risk assessment.\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### SOLUTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "*This project implements three machine learning models:\n",
    "1. Decision Tree (baseline)\n",
    "2. MLP Neural Network (reproduced model)\n",
    "3. Random Forest (contribution model)\n",
    "\n",
    "The models are evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves. The Random Forest model serves as the significant contribution and demonstrates improved performance over the baseline.\n"
